> This is a online sticker board, it syncs to the database on save and can dinamically create new boards to be used. This project was created in under 24h as personal challange. The main lessons that were learned in this project were the usefulness of state managment (This will be the next topic I will be learning more in depth) and componentization, that allowed me to reuse components in my pages that otherwise would have taken me some time to replicate and adapt, and would have made my code clunkier.
> Another challange faced was the dragging feature, that made this project to much fun. It was a struggle to figure a way to store all the necessary data for each sticker, but the lib so much fun to work with that I can't recommend it enough. Check it out at [react-draggable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable#draggable-usage).
